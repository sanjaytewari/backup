# Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df' with Employee data
# Example DataFrame
# df = pd.DataFrame({'id': ..., 'name': ..., 'managerId': ...})

# Step 1: Create a groupby operation to count employees by managerId
manager_count = df[df['managerId'].notnull()].groupby('managerId').size().reset_index(name='employee_count')

# Step 2: Filter out managers with fewer than 5 employees
managers_with_5_or_more = manager_count[manager_count['employee_count'] >= 5]

# Step 3: Merge this filtered data back with the original Employee DataFrame

# Step 4: Select only the 'name' column
